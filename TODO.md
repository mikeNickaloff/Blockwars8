- Change 1: Assemble a pure-QML editor workflow using `PowerupEditorView.qml`, `PowerupCardView.qml`, and `PowerupCatalogList.qml`, delegating card behavior to abstract helper types.
- Change 1: Connect QuickFlux actions to control editor visibility, card selection, and persistence while preserving the established JSON data contract.
- Change 1: Persist editor changes to the `localPowerupData` LocalStorage table through `SQLDataStorage.qml`, encoding assignment and data payloads with shared hex utilities.
